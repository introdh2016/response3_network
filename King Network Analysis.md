Networks in digital humanities can provide a way to find many connections with just about anything. In the Demystifying Networks article, Scott B. Weingart explains that a network is "a net-like arrangment of threads, wires, etc." (Weingart, Demystifying Networks, Parts I and II) Networking is also simply known as a complex interlocking system, that shows relaionships with things we may not have thought to have any connection with at all. It is possible to make a network with anything that has a connection with something else. In this paper, I will discuss the network analysis of NFL receivers , and the NFL defensivive players that they are tackled by. I will also discuss the importance of why the connection of reciever and tackler may matter in network anaylsis, and mention any particular arguments that may appear within this project.

The network that is shown below of NFL receivers, and the defensive players that they are tackled by was created in Gephi. In order to create this network, I first had to edit a complete edge and node list, in order to fit corectly in Gephi and produce the best results. Before editing the edge and node list, I first had to download the data from the edge list and open it in excel. Gephi will not function correctly if the data is opened in Microsoft Word. When I opened the edgelist in Excel two columns appeared. One column had receivers, and the other had the defensive players who tackled the receivers. I renamed the two columns, source and target. I also switched the columns around, so it would be easier to understand who tackled who. In order for me to create my nodes list, I had to take every name from the edge list, and put them ino one single column. I put each players name in alphabetical order, and deleated all the repeating names. Then I renamed the column to ID, leaving me with 20 offensive players, and 20 defensive players. An edge list are lines that connect to points, which are known as nodes. The edges and nodes in a network allow us to see different connections that can lead to new interesting information. When my graph was created I noticed it was pretty difficult to read with all the edges overlaping each other. So in order to make the graph easier to understand, I changed the layout to "Fruchterman Reingold". This layout was more spread out, and easier to tell the connection between who tackled which receiver.
