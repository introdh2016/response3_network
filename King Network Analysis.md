Networks in digital humanities can provide a way to find many connections with just about anything. In the Demystifying Networks article, Scott B. Weingart explains that a network is "a net-like arrangment of threads, wires, etc." (Weingart, Demystifying Networks, Parts I and II) Networking is also simply known as a complex interlocking system, that shows relaionships with things we may not have thought to have any connection with at all. It is possible to make a network with anything that has a connection with something else. In this paper, I will discuss the network analysis of NFL receivers , and the NFL defensivive players that they are tackled by. I will also discuss the importance of why the connection of reciever and tackler may matter in network anaylsis, and mention any particular arguments that may appear within this project.

The network that is shown below of NFL receivers, and the defensive players that they are tackled by was created in Gephi. In order to create this network, I first had to edit a complete edge and node list, in order to fit corectly in Gephi and produce the best results. An edge list are lines that connect to points, which are known as nodes. The edges and nodes in a network allow us to see different connections that can lead to new interesting information.
