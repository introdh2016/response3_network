# Network Analysis Assignment 

Part 1: Network
Build your network in Gephi. Save images of your networks to include in your paper. 


Part 2: Paper

The 500-1500 word paper should address the following:

- Discuss the role of networks in DH/ study of the humanities.
- Assuming the reader is unfamiliar with the data, contextualize and develop some initial arguments about your network. 
- What questions does your network generate about your data?
- Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas outlined by Weingart and Newman and from in-class discussions of projects like Linked Jazz,
discuss the challenges/limits of network analysis as applied to your network and for network analysis generally.  

# Data

## Supreme Court

Pick an issue or two and analyze it.  The [code book](http://scdb.wustl.edu/documentation.php?s=1) lists what [each issue number in the data set means](https://github.com/introdh2016/response3_network/blob/master/ussc-31.zip).

Edge list: Make sure to add "Source" and "Target" to the edge list (this is particular to Gephi). 

Node: Select the [Supreme Court Node List](https://github.com/introdh2016/labs/blob/master/scotus_nodes.csv) by your issue number in a program like Excel.  Then, copy and paste that subset into a new .csv file.  This is the node list. The first column should be "ID" (this is particular to Gephi). 

## Football

The data shows who tackled whom in 2015.

Edge list: https://github.com/introdh2016/labs/blob/master/nfl_network_data.csv

(includes top 20 tackler and top 20 receiver)

Edgst list Top 30: https://github.com/introdh2016/labs/blob/master/nfl_network_data_30_2015.csv
(includes top 30 tackler and top 30 receiver)

Edge list: Make sure to add "Source" and "Target" to the edge list (this is particular to Gephi). 

Node list: Create a node list by puttng the receivers and tacklers in a single column called "ID".
