Response #3 Networks

	Networks play a vital role in digital humanities and the study of humanities because they provide a way for the relationships between topics or people to be visually represented and interpreted. With topic models and other data used in digital humanities, we are given a good idea of how individual data sets are created and what they are made of. But when we introduce networking, we are given a much clearer idea of how the different data sets influence one another. Networks can be applied to more than just topic models, however, as we looked at some examples in class of network representations being combined with maps. This aspect of networking is particularly interesting for me because when we were first introduced to networking I would have never predicted that it could be associated with what we learned during our mapping unit. 
	I networked data regarding players being tackled and tacklers in NFL games. First, I downloaded data from the edges list and put that into Microsoft Excel. The edges list included two columns, for who was tackled and the tackler. I renamed these two columns source and target, and it moved the data set into my data table on Gephi. To create my nodes list, I took all the names from my edges list and put them into one column. I alphabetized the column and deleted all of the repeating names. When I was left with 40 total players, 20 offensive and 20 defensive, I renamed the column ID and moved that data set into Gephi as my nodes set. When I created my graph I observed that it was a good representation of who has been tackling certain players and who has been getting tackled by certain players. 
	Some questions that arose about my data as I created my network is the amount of times each player was tackled by the particular tackler he is being linked. While we can see every individual that tackled the given player, we cant see how many times each of those individuals tackled that player. In other words, if we look at our graph we don’t know how many tackles went into the line between two players. So, the network I created is more of a representation of which players came into contact with each other at least one time, rather than a representation of who was tackled the least or who was tackled the most, which is what I was left wondering about. 
	While I found the Linked Jazz project to be a little bit more interesting then the one we completed, I think it is interesting to not that the relationship outlined in Linked Jazz is much more broadly defined and less concrete then the relationship we focused on in our network. Linked Jazz analyzes the influence the jazz musicians had on one another, which is very hard to quantify and define. In our networking project, we looked at a simple statistic, tackling, which is much easier to categorize. 
	One aspect of networks that presents difficulties is determining when to use them. Because Networking is such a helpful and wide reaching tool, people have a tendency to use it in situations where it may not necessarily be beneficial. While networks always be used, its important to choose certain situations where it will enhance the viewers understanding of the data. “Networks can be used on any project. Networks should be used on far fewer” (Weingart).
	In Networks: An Introduction, Mark Newman describes the main advantage of creating networks; the fact that they can lead to discoveries and insights that would otherwise be undetectable. Lets look at the graph we created for example. While we would be able to tell who was tackled by who by simply examining a chart, it would be a tedious process to go through each instance a player was tackled. When the network is presented in the form of a graph, we can take in the information much quicker and in a way that tells us immediately which players have come into contact with one another.
